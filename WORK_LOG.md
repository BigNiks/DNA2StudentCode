| Oct 8  |   3:30-4 PM   |                                                                                                                                                                                                         I am currently thinking of ways to approach this problem. I first thought of using hashmaps. Although I can see a way we could probably solve this problem using it, I know for a fact that it is going to be very inefficient. |
| Oct 10 | 12:40-1:45 PM |                              I have thought of a couple different ways to approach this problem, but I still don't think I've found an efficient solution. I thought about assigning every character their own specific numerical value, and calculating the expected amount with the total amount. This process to me just seems like an iterative approach with extra steps so I botched that idea after working through it on paper. |
| Oct 12 |    5-6 PM     |                                                                                                  I have decided to try and go back to thinking about hashmaps and I've been trying to work through some solutions on paper. I overheard Mr. Blick talk about something called hashing which I'm sure we will learn about more later. I am going to refrain from doing an research on hashing and continue to try and solve this my way. |
| Oct 18 | 8:45-9:55 AM  |                                                                                                                                                          Today was all about catching up after being sick and learning about horner's law, rolling polynomial functions, and other things relating to the solution of this problem. I spent most of my time today talking with Mr. Blick to make sure I understood what I needed to do. |
| Oct 20 |   10-11 AM    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I spent the first 30 minutes going over the notes of the talk I had with Mr. Blick as well as reading over the packet. I spent the other 30 minutes beginning to code a search function as well as the hash function. |
| Oct 21 |    2-3 PM     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I continued to code and finished both functions. Although my code is only returning zero, so I am looking into that issue. I tried a couple solutions but it either only returns 0 or has a string overflow error. |
| Oct 22 |    8-9 PM     | So I realized why my code was either returning 0 or an insanely big number, I wasn't properly counting the longest STR string. Instead I was simply counting all the STRs in the sequence. I have tweaked my code to only count the longest consecutive STRs but I'm still getting a string overflow error in my hash function. I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out why its overflowing but I am still yet to find out why. |
